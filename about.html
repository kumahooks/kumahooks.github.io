							Hi! I am Kuma, also going for Meryl and Bear. 
							<br>
							Software engineer by day, wannabe hacker by night - focusing primarily on reverse-engineering games and malware.
							<br>
							Most stuff I know are self-taught, which is probably why I suck a lot.
							<br>
							As you probably noticed, I am a lot into <a href="lain.html">Lain</a>, CTF, music and novels. 
							<br><br><br>
							You can send me an e-mail if for whatever reason you want to: <a>kuma</a> at <a>insiberia.net</a>
							<br>
							<a href="songs.html">This</a> is a list of songs I highly recommend anyone listening to! :)

Recently I decided to develop and a few weeks ago had already deployed a simple currency flipper for Path of Exile. While there are a few remaining TODOs to address, the application is mostly complete and ready for use. You can access it [here](https://bearbearsbarebear.github.io/poe).

To overcome certain browser security checks, I employed some tricks during the development process. However, overall, the code is simple and easy to understand. For those interested in exploring the inner workings, the code can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/bearbearsbarebear/bearbearsbarebear.github.io/blob/main/js/poe.js). (Please bear with me with the quality of the code! :P)

This idea can of course be expanded, given the bugs are fixed and some other features are also included. Since it accomplished the goal I had for this season's league, I mostly stopped developing it, at least for now. Maybe next league I will be making a new post about new features, bug corrections and stuff. Who knows? :)
